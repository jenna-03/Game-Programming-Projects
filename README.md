# Game-Programming-Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic games developed in Python and C++. Each game showcases fundamental programming concepts such as control flow, object-oriented design, and efficient data handling in both languages.

## Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:
- **Python Games**: A collection of games developed in Python, focusing on simplicity and ease of understanding.
- **C++ Games**: A collection of games implemented in C++, demonstrating efficient performance and memory management.

Each game resides in its respective folder, and detailed explanations about the gameplay and features can be found within those folders.

## Requirements
To run the games, ensure you have the following:

### Python
- Python 3.x or above: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### C++
- A C++ compiler like GCC or an IDE that supports C++11 or higher.

## How to Run

### Python Games
1. Navigate to the Python game directory.
2. Run the game using:
   ```bash
   python3 <game_name>.py

### C++ Games
1. Navigate to the C++ game directory
2. Compile the game using:
   g++ <game_name>.cpp -o <output_name>
3. Run the game using:
    ./<output_name>
